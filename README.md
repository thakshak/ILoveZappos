# ILoveZappos

This app was created for a challenge by www.zappos.com

This app takes input from the user as a search query and returns the first item (there could be more than one) and display it as a product page.

There is a **floating action button** on the product page for adding the current item to cart which **animates when clicked.**

There is a **share button** on the top toolbar(or action bar) to share the current product to anyone who can view the same product in this app when clicked on the shared link.

Used **Android Databinding library** for the product page.

Used **Retrofit2 API** to handle the REST Requests.

Created the App Icon modifying Zappos logo which displays Iâ™¥Zappos.
